# pzexeconfig-installer
Config that is downloaded originates here: https://gist.github.com/aoqia194/f93a6d9cdfd66388c46ada22d067b058

## Usage
`install` bin downloads the config to the Project Zomboid install directory. Will never get deleted by Steam or by uninstall but requires you to add `-pzexeconfig ProjectZomboid64aoqia.json` to the launch options.

`overwrite` bin downloads the config to the Project Zomboid directory and overwrites the original `ProjectZomboid64.json` config. This means that it will be replaced when Steam does it's CRC checks.
